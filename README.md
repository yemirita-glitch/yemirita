# Executive Summary
The sales dashboard reveals strong overall revenue performance with a total revenue of $217,575,000 and an average revenue of $2,175,750 per transaction. Sales activities are driven by 7 products, supported by 10 sales representatives, and distributed across 14 customers and 4 regions. Revenue is largely concentrated in high-performing products, regions, and customers, indicating both strengths and potential risks in sales dependency.
Analysis of revenue by product shows that TV 43Q is the highest revenue-generating product, followed by Laptop A15 and Tablet T8. Products such as Speaker S10 and Monitor M24 contribute the least to total revenue.
Quarterly analysis indicates that Quarter 1 (Q1) recorded higher revenue compared to Quarter 2 (Q2), showing a noticeable decline in sales performance.
The category and revenue by region analysis highlights that the East region generates the highest revenue, followed by the South region, while North and West regions lag. Across all regions, Electronics and Mobile categories dominate revenue contribution, whereas Audio and Peripherals contribute minimally.
Customer-level analysis shows that FemTech, Musa Enterprises, and Omega Wholesale contribute the highest revenue and unit sales. Conversely, customers such as Adewale Store and Tope & Sons contribute the least.
While a small group of sales representatives drives the majority of revenue, the Bottom 5 Sales Representatives—including Peter Obi, Mary John, Job Austin, Praise Odunayo, and Aba Joel—record significantly lower revenue contributions.
The product demand analysis shows that Tablet T8 records the highest number of units sold, followed by TV 43Q and Laptop A15, while Phone X12 has the lowest units sold.

Insight
Revenue is concentrated in a few products, customers, and regions.
Electronics and Mobile categories are the primary revenue drivers.
There is a decline in revenue from Q1 to Q2.
Significant performance gaps exist among sales representatives.
High-volume products do not always yield the highest revenue.

 Recommendations
Strengthen marketing and inventory support for high-performing products and regions.
Develop strategies to improve sales performance in North and West regions. For instance, to improve sales performance in the North and West regions, the organization should implement localized marketing strategies, optimize product mix by focusing on high-demand items, enhance sales representative
performance through training and incentives, expand the customer base, introduce flexible pricing options, strengthen distribution channels, and continuously monitor performance using data-driven tools.
Implement customer retention programs for top customers while expanding the customer base.
Provide training and incentives to underperforming sales representatives.
Investigate causes of quarterly revenue decline and introduce corrective measures.
